Dow giant Nike (NKE) rose on strong earnings after the close. The stock market rally finished slightly higher Tuesday, with the Dow Jones setting a record close, to cap another strong month and quarter. NOW PLAYING These Companies Want To Replace Nvidia In China. Can They Succeed? Nvidia (NVDA) broke out of a base while CoreWeave (CRWV) gapped up on news. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is setting up just below a buy point. The video embedded in the article reviews Tuesday's market action and analyzes Nvidia, Ralph Lauren (RL) and Pagaya stock. Government Shutdown The federal government's funding ran out at midnight, triggering a partial government shutdown. Democrats are demanding that President Donald Trump extend expiring ObamaCare subsidies and reverse recent Medicaid cuts. Trump has threatened to fire a slew of federal workers permanently in a shutdown. Tesla China Finishes Q3 Strong But Global Deliveries Are All About This Dow Jones Futures Today Dow Jones futures lost 0.3% vs. fair value, even with Nike giving blue chips a lift. S&P 500 futures fell 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.5%. Futures are off overnight lows. Investors will get the ADP Employment report for September at 8:15 a.m. ET. The September ISM manufacturing index and August construction spending data are due at 10 a.m. ET.

Join IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks and the market on IBD Live  Nike Earnings  Nike earnings topped fiscal Q1 views Tuesday night while sales unexpectedly edged higher, signaling a turnaround is underway.  NKE stock rose solidly overnight, signaling a move above a long-sliding 200-day moving average. Shares edged higher Tuesday.  U.S. To Take Lithium Americas Stake  Lithium Americas (LAC) surged overnight after Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that the U.S. government will take a stake in the Canadian lithium producer, confirming recent reports.  Tesla Rivals Report Record Deliveries  Tesla (TSLA) rivals XPeng (XPEV), Nio (NIO) and Xiaomi (XIACY) reported record monthly and quarterly deliveries overnight, BYD (BYDDF) had lackluster sales at best while Li Auto (LI) released weak results.  Tesla reports Q3 deliveries before Thursday's open. The EV giant significantly raised U.S. lease prices on Oct. 1, following the Sept. 30 expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit.  Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally was slightly lower for much of the session but firmed up late for modest gains.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Tuesday's stock market trading, a new closing high. The S&P 500 index advanced 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 edged up less than 0.1%, rebounding higher from the 21-day line.  For the month, the Dow rose 1.9%, the S&P 500 3.5%, the Nasdaq 5.6% and the Russell 2000 3%.  Leading stocks were mixed Tuesday. Nvidia and CoreWeave were among the winners, but losers predominated Tuesday.  But Spotify (SPOT) fell back from a buy area while payment and lending stocks such as Pagaya Technologies (PGY) and SoFi Technologies (SOFI) were notable losers.  Sports-betting plays such as DraftKings (DKNG) sold off a day after Robinhood Markets (HOOD) touted significant inroads into prediction markets.  U.S. crude oil prices fell 1.7% to $62.37 a barrel amid reports that OPEC+ is mulling a big November production hike on Sunday.  The 10-year Treasury yield rose 1 basis point to 4.15%. A lengthy government shutdown could unnerve bond markets. The government won't release economic data during a shutdown, including the September jobs report scheduled for Friday.  ETFs  Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) dipped 0.3%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 0.8%, with Palantir stock the biggest component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) rallied 1.15%. Nvidia stock is the No. 1 holding in SMH.  ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) edged up 0.15% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) gained 1.8%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across ARK Invest's ETFs.  SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) declined 0.3%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) retreated 1.1% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) popped 2.4%. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) advanced 0.8%. The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) shed 0.5%.  Best Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch  Nvidia Stock  Nvidia stock rallied 2.6% to 186.58, clearing a 184.48 flat-base buy point after finding support at the 50-day line last week.  CoreWeave Stock  CoreWeave stock gapped up 11.7% to 136.85, briefly topping a 138.95 short-term high. The Nvidia-backed IPO jumped on an expanded cloud-computing deal with Meta Platforms (META).  Palantir Stock  Palantir stock advanced 2% to 182.42, trading within a cup-with-handle base with a 185.75 buy point, according to MarketSurge. PLTR stock arguably is offering an early entry.  What To Do Now  The stock market rally continues to trend higher. A lengthy government shutdown could have stock market implications, but Wall Street isn't concerned so far.  Investors should be heavily invested.  Many leaders are significantly extended, but Nvidia breaking out and Palantir just below a buy point shows that investors should still be looking for new opportunities.  Some leaders have weakened, though, often around buy points like Spotify and Roblox.  So stay engaged and ready to act, in either direction.  Palantir is on IBD Leaderboard, with Tesla on the Leaderboard watchlist. Nvidia stock, SoFi, Palantir are on the IBD 50. SoFi stock and Palantir are on the IBD Big Cap 20.

Meanwhile, investors kept an eye on developments in Washington, weighing the chances of a lengthy US government shutdown.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three major averages posted new records.

A wave of good news from the AI sector lifted chip stocks worldwide, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising to a record high. AMD (AMD) and SK Hynix (000660.KS, HXSCL) also gained.  OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) valuation soared to $500 billion after an employee share sale, boosting tech rally hopes despite fears of an AI bubble. The ChatGPT maker ousted Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) as the most valuable startup in the world.  Markets have so far been unperturbed by the US government shutdown, which looks set to drag on at least until the end of the week. President Trump is amping up his rhetoric against Democrats, threatening to fire ""thousands"" of federal workers and canceling billions of dollars in federal funding to blue states.  Trump said he is meeting on Thursday with OMB Director Russ Vought, who has been leading White House strategy in the shutdown, to discuss which ""Democrat Agencies"" should be cut.  In any case, Friday's scheduled release of the September jobs report is all but certain to be delayed. That has Wall Street looking elsewhere during the federal data blackout, as Fed policymakers have indicated cracks in the labor market will loom large in their October rate decision.  Private data from the firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday found hiring plans at their lowest level since 2009, even as layoffs fell.

Around 750,000 federal employees— including those in the Bureau of Labor Statistics — might be furloughed, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If that happens, September’s jobs report will not be released as scheduled on Friday, leaving the Federal Reserve and investors in the dark about the state of the U.S. labor market.  While the shutdown was only confirmed around 9 a.m. Singapore time (9 p.m. ET), it appeared imminent during trading hours Tuesday. But markets seemed to shrug off such concerns, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  even hitting a new high.  Shares of Nvidia  also closed at a record, which pushed the company past a $4.5 trillion market cap, while CoreWeave stock jumped nearly 12% on an artificial intelligence infrastructure agreement with Meta  .  Indeed, the flurry of AI deals announced during the month, with OpenAI at the center of many of them, turbocharged the stock market. In September, the S&P 500  added more than 3%, blowing past its historical average of a 4.2% fall for the month.  While the U.S. government has been put to sleep as September ended, investors, hopefully, had their eyes peeled during the month.  What you need to know today  The U.S. government shuts down.

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% to close at a record high for a second straight day. The benchmark S&P 500 ended up 0.3% to set its own new closing high after earlier registering a fresh intraday record. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.4% and approached its intraday and closing records.  Gold futures were up 0.6% to $3,895 an ounce at 4:00 p.m. ET after earlier touching a record $3,922.70. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, ticked lower to 97.71, while the 10-year Treasury yield—which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans—fell to 4.10% from 4.15% Tuesday. Bitcoin advanced 2.7% to about $117,500, while oil futures slipped 0.6% to about $62 per barrel.  A midnight deadline to keep the government open came and went without Congress passing a measure, as Republicans and Democrats in Congress are at a standoff over healthcare funding. As a result, some government offices are closed and the shutdown could delay the release of crucial economic data, including Friday's report on the job market from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  According to ADP, the U.S. unexpectedly lost 32,000 private-sector jobs in September—the biggest decline since March 2023—in the latest sign of a weakening labor market. An increase of 45,000 jobs was seen, per economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.  In corporate news, Nike (NKE) shares ended more than 6% higher after the sneaker giant surprisingly recorded a quarterly sales increase; Lithium Americas (LAC) stock popped 23% on news the U.S. government would take a stake in the Canadian company and its Nevada mining project; and Docusign (DOCU) shares, which sank 12% yesterday on news OpenAI is launching a competing product called DocuGPT, closed down a further 4%.  AES (AES) shares soared nearly 17% to lead the S&P 500 in early trading on a Financial Times report that BlackRock (BLK)-owned Global Infrastructure Partners was near a deal to acquire the power plants operator for $38 billion. Shares of Intel (INTC) surged 7% on a report that the firm is in early stage talks with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to add its rival as a foundry customer.  Also, Pfizer (PFE) stock rose a further 7% a day after surging nearly 7% to pace the S&P 500 as it announced lower prices on several medications in the U.S. with President Trump at the White House. U.S.-listed shares of European drugmakers AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) were up roughly 10% and 7%, respectively, and Eli Lilly (LLY) shares surged about 8% after Trump also revealed plans to launch a website for consumers to purchase drugs from manufacturers at a discount, helping provide clarity for the industry after the president had sent a letter over the summer urging pharma firms to lower costs for Americans.  Biggest S&P 500 Movers on Wednesday  October 01, 2025 06:31 PM EDT  Advancers  Shares of renewable energy provider AES (AES) surged nearly 17%, gaining the most of any S&P 500 stock. The push higher followed reports that Global Infrastructure Partners, owned by asset management giant BlackRock (BLK), is in talks to buy AES. The deal could be worth around $38 billion, which would make it one of the largest infrastructure takeovers ever.  Pharmaceutical stocks and others in the healthcare sector extended their gains Wednesday, a day after Pfizer (PFE) became the first major drugmaker to comply with a push from the White House cut medication prices in the U.S. to the lower levels seen in other countries. According to media reports, other major pharma companies could follow Pfizer's lead and seek pricing deals with the Trump administration. Shares of Biogen (BIIB), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) rose about 10%, 9% and 8%, respectively.  Shares of memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) advanced close to 9%, along with hard drive makers Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC). The moves extended recent gains on anticipation they could benefit from growing demand for data storage to support AI.  Decliners  Corteva (CTVA) shares tumbled 9.1%, logging the S&P 500's weakest performance Wednesday, after the agricultural sciences firm announced a plan to split its crop protection and its seed businesses into two independent companies. The company expects the transaction to be complete by the second half of 2026.  Interpublic Group (IPG) stock lost 5% on Wednesday, reversing gains posted in the prior session after German biotech giant Bayer (BAYRY) named IPG as the exclusive creative and media partner for its consumer health business. IPG and fellow marketing firm Omnicom (OMC) announced that the regulatory approval process for their intended merger remains in progress and that they expect the deal to close by year-end. Omnicom shares also slipped 5%.  Shares of tech-focused research firm Gartner (IT) fell 4.5%. Although the U.S. federal government accounts for less than 5% of Gartner's revenue, the government shutdown weighed on sentiment across the advisory industry. Gartner stock has also faced pressure stemming from concerns about how AI could disrupt the research business.  -Michael Bromberg  Fermi Shares Soar in Trading Debut  October 01, 2025 06:18 PM EDT  Shares of Fermi (FRMI), the developer of one of the world’s largest AI data center campuses, soared on their first day of trading Wednesday in yet another sign of Wall Street's appetite for all things AI.  Fermi stock rose 55% on Wednesday to close at $32.53, after pricing its IPO at $21 a share. The stock was up an additional 7% in after-hours trading.  Fermi is the latest in a string of AI-related IPOs that have attracted strong interest from investors this year. The stock of design software maker Figma (FIG) skyrocketed 250% in its first day of trading in July, and shares of cloud computing provider Coreweave (CRWV) are up more than 200% since their March debut.  Toby Neugebauer, chief executive officer of Fermi Inc., speaks before ringing the closing bell during the company's initial public offering (IPO) at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.  Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer speaking Wednesday at the Nasdaq MarketSite.  Victor J. Blue / Bloomberg / Getty Images  Fermi is an unconventional stock in several respects. First, it has no revenue. The company was founded in January and is in the early stages of developing the President Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus, a huge data center facility situated on a 5,000-acre site in the Texas Panhandle. The plan is to build 15 million square feet of data center capacity—equivalent to about 260 football fields—that’s hooked up to 11 GW of natural gas, nuclear, and solar power. Fermi expects to break ground on its first data centers next March, and hopes to have 1.1 GW of power available to tenants by the end of next year.  Fermi’s listing as a real estate investment trust (REIT) also sets it apart from nearly every other AI investment. REITs are required to disburse 90% of their profit to investors, which isn't exactly conducive to funding the kind of explosive growth that most investors have come to expect from AI-related businesses. It will also likely be a while before Fermi can pay a dividend, considering it doesn't expect to have data centers available for lease before the end of next year.  Fermi's single-site portfolio is also highly unusual; most REITs, including competing data center landlords Digital Realty (DLR) and Equinix (EQIX), tout vast property portfolios that offer investors the benefits of diversification. Fermi's planned campus may be enormous, but it's still only one property.  -Colin Laidley  Government Shutdowns Usually Don't Bother Stocks. Could This Time Be Different?  October 01, 2025 04:07 PM EDT  The federal government just shut down for the first time in six years, and the stock market—characteristically—took it in stride. But could that change?  The benchmark S&P 500 ended up 0.3% Wednesday. The muted response was no surprise to market watchers: Government shutdowns may be dramatic, but they haven’t been a major headwinds for the stock market—particularly recently, with the last time the S&P 500 declined during one coming in 1990.  Over the past 50 years, the average S&P 500 return during a government shutdown has been a decline of 1.6%, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial. The worst shutdown for stocks was in 1979, when the S&P 500 lost more than 6%.  The most recent shutdown, which lasted from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019, was the longest in history. The S&P 500 rose more than 10% in that period as investors looked past the noise of the shutdown and focused on the Federal Reserve’s pivot to more dovish policy after raising interest rates four times in 2018.  “Investors have generally looked past budget-related disruptions, prioritizing corporate earnings, broader economic trends, and other key macroeconomic factors,” Turnquist said."

The AI tech trade is proving too powerful for naysayers — yesterday NVIDIA NVDA became the first company to amass a $4.5 trillion market cap, and the stock rose again today. Tesla TSLA deliveries are expected to be the best of the year, with the expiration of the EV tax credit due.  As good as any stock you can name, gold is also hitting record highs today: $3895 per troy ounce amounts to a +45% gain year to date. This can be seen as a hedge against things like the government shutdown, should it cause unforeseen problems. Gold prices had been as high as $3915 per troy ounce during the course of the trading day.  The Dow gained +43 points today, a mere +0.09%, and the S&P 500 crossed 6700 for the first time ever as of a session close, +22 points or +0.34%. The Nasdaq had the best day of the top indexes, +95 points or +0.42% today and setting a new high of 22,755 as of the closing bell. The small-cap Russell 2000 is still off its September 18th all-time highs, but gained +5 points, +0.24%.  Manufacturing Data Basically In-Line  Aside from the -32K private-sector jobs created last month as per ADP, both ISM Manufacturing and final S&P Manufacturing PMI numbers for September came in pretty much as expected: ISM came in 10 basis points (bps) above projections to +49.1%, up 40 bps from the August headline. S&P was steady at +52.0, the same as the prior month and as analysts expected.  Construction spending data for August was delayed today, due to the federal shutdown. Analysts have forecast a drop to -0.2% for the month, down from -0.1% the previous month.  What to Expect from the Stock Market Thursday  Succinctly put: not much. We won’t be seeing any Weekly Jobless Claims numbers tomorrow morning, as they are supplied by the U.S. Department of Labor, which is closed currently — and for who knows how long. Factory Orders for August are put together by the U.S. Census Bureau, so don’t expect them either.  How long can the stock market float above the rigors of the economy, especially considering we have clear signs of an unraveling labor force? For now, the momentum from the AI trade — among other things: Pfizer PFE shares were up following a sweetheart deal made with the President of the United States — is proving to be the supreme market catalyst.

The S&P 500 climbed 0.4% to set an all-time high following mixed trading on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 63 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.7% to its own record.  Advanced Micro Devices helped lead the way and soared 23.7% after announcing a deal where OpenAI will use its chips to power AI infrastructure. As part of the deal, OpenAI could own up to 160 million shares of AMD if it hits certain milestones.  A frenzy around AI has been one of the main reasons Wall Street has been hitting record after record, though that's also raising worries that prices have potentially shot too high. Much of the furor around AI in the last couple weeks has come from OpenAI, which has quickly grown into a $500 billion company. It's been announcing deals with businesses around the world to develop more AI infrastructure.  Another chip company, Nvidia, announced a deal last month where it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a partnership, creating criticism that the AI investment pipeline was beginning to appear like a circle. Nvidia slipped 1.1% following the AMD announcement. Because it's the most valuable stock on Wall Street, Nvidia was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500.  Outside of tech, Comerica jumped 13.7% after Fifth Third Bancorp agreed to buy it in an all-stock deal valued at $10.9 billion. The combination would create the country's ninth-largest bank. Fifth Third's stock fell 1.4%.  Tesla rose 5.4% after social-media postings by the electric-vehicle maker hinted at a possible product unveiling coming on Tuesday.  Verizon Communications fell 5.1% after the telecom replaced its chief executive. Dan Schulman, a director at the company and former CEO of PayPal, is taking over for Hans Vestburg.  Elsewhere on Wall Street, trading was relatively quiet as the stock market continues to largely ignore the U.S. government's shutdown. Past closures of the federal government have had minimal effect on the stock market or on the economy, and the bet on Wall Street is that something similar will happen again.  All told, the S&P 500 rose 24.49 points to 6,740.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 63.31 to 46,694.97, and the Nasdaq composite rose 161.16 to 22,941.67.  Politics are playing a bigger role in stock markets abroad, as Japanese stocks soared and French stocks slumped following their latest political shake-ups.  Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 4.8% after the country's Liberal Democratic Party chose Sanae Takaichi as its leader. She was an ally of the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who pushed for lower interest rates and other policies that investors liked.  The yen's value dropped against the U.S. dollar on expectations that Takaichi will boost spending, likely adding to inflationary pressures. That in turn helped push up stocks of Japanese exporters, whose products can become more attractive on the global market when the yen is cheaper."

The U.S. government shutdown is also in its second week.  The benchmark S&P 500 climbed 0.58% to close at 6,753.72, supported by a rise in the index’s information technology, utilities and industrials sectors. All three sectors notched fresh closing highs. The Nasdaq Composite  advanced 1.12% to finish at 23,043.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 1.20 points to end the day at 46,601.78.  Stocks showed little reaction to the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September meeting, where it cut rates for the first time in 2025. The minutes showed a Fed divided over how much further to cut rates.  Nvidia  shares rose 2% after CEO Jensen Huang said that demand has risen in recent months, telling CNBC that “this year, particularly the last six months, demand of computing has gone up substantially.” Huang also confirmed the company’s involvement in funding Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, and said that he’s “super excited about the financing opportunity they’re doing.”  “We know some of the things AI can do. We can all be impressed with some of the capabilities, but at the end of the day, there needs to be demand for the chips, demand for whatever the software layer that’s built on top of all that compute looks like,” Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield said to CNBC. “The demand still being there – and Nvidia is obviously in the best position in the world to comment on that – I do think is reassuring that the level of spending capex isn’t completely circular.”  The move comes just a day after the AI chip darling finished lower in sympathy with Oracle shares after a report that Oracle was seeing lighter margins in its cloud business than analysts were forecasting. The report also claimed the company is losing money on some of its deals to rent out Nvidia’s chips.  That added to fears that the stock market is caught up in an AI bubble that harkens back to the late 1990s, when a feeding frenzy on early internet companies eventually led to the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Many market observers are urging investors to rebalance their portfolios, while also acknowledging there could be further upside before the AI rally exhausts itself.  “Even if you look at the late-’90s, we had big corrections in the Nasdaq every single year, so I think there’s going to continue to be this enthusiasm for a sell-off in tech stocks,” Mayfield said. “There could be several corrections, big corrections in tech stocks, you know DeepSeek-type moments, before we ultimately get to some sort of bull market top. I just don’t really feel that we’re close there.”  Meanwhile, the current government shutdown dragged into its eighth day Wednesday, with the Senate once again rejecting dueling stopgap funding bills. The vote marks the sixth time the chamber was unable to advance legislation to reopen the government.  The stoppage has weighed little on equities thus far, but poses a greater risk to sentiment the longer it wears on, given the potential hits to the U.S. economy. President Donald Trump has suggested that not all federal workers who have been furloughed will receive back pay, saying Tuesday that “it depends on who we’re talking about.” Active-duty military members might also miss a paycheck scheduled for Oct. 15."

But President Donald Trump has added a twist — following the golden shares, or new equity stakes that give the government a special interest in companies' fates.  Stock market investors have bid up Intel (INTC), MP Materials (MP) and the entire U.S. steel sector after Trump leveraged U.S. government support to pry away significant equity stakes or effective veto power. Trump's readiness to intervene on behalf of chosen companies, even at the cost of competitors and customers, clashes with traditional Republican views that the economy thrives when the government stays out of the way of markets.  ↑  NOW PLAYING  The U.S. Now Owns 10% Of Intel. What That Means For America’s Chip Supply.  Like it or not, a brash new Trump economy is ringing in elements of state capitalism. Building on the sweeping Trump tariffs, the White House is pushing into previously out-of-bounds business activity, from a golden share in U.S. Steel to taking a cut of the proceeds from Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) AI chip sales to China.  Those moves are unprecedented"

Investors turned their focus to weak ADP jobs data, which helped cement bets on near-term rate cuts.  The S&P 500 (^GSPC) advanced 0.3% to notch its first record close above 6,700. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained nearly 0.1% to post its second consecutive record close.

Wall Street largely shrugged off the expected economic impact of the government shutdown, at least for now. The longer it lasts, the greater the likely hit to growth, as the fallout reaches the businesses that rely on the federal government's daily output.  The shutdown comes at a potentially perilous time for the economy, as the ADP's monthly employment report — in especially high focus Wednesday — showed private payrolls unexpectedly declined last month. The private sector lost 32,000 jobs, the report said, missing expectations for a gain of over 50,000.  That report likely spurred further bets on coming interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, however. Around 99% of bets are on a cut later this month, and expectations for a December cut — now at about 87% — also saw a big jump.  In Washington, agencies will now implement contingency plans and send hundreds of thousands of workers home, amid warnings from President Trump that ""a lot"" of firings are to come.  Markets are watching the developments closely. Among the agencies whose work is set to be frozen is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which gathers and reports economic data key to Federal Reserve policy decisions.  The BLS was set to release the September jobs report on Friday. But the nonfarm payrolls update is likely to be delayed, as BLS plans to ""completely cease operations"" with just one full-time employee kept in post.  The shutdown isn't the only Trump policy push in focus on Wednesday, which marks the promised implementation of 100% tariffs on a range of pharmaceutical products and 25% duties on heavy-duty trucks."

Overall M&A has been picking up, adding to the animal spirits seen in the stock market this year.  “There is clearly an optimistic view of growth in the long term,” said Brian Mulberry, senior client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “There is a more business (and bank) friendly regulatory environment and everyone expects rates to be much lower by this time next year, perhaps even as much as 1.25% lower, making the return on these deals much better and faster.”  Investors have been looking past concerns about the current U.S. government shutdown, which has now dragged on into a second week after lawmakers once again failed to reach a deal on funding to keep the government open. The shutdown delayed the release of key economic data — including the September jobs report — which was originally due Friday.  “As of now, the stock market is shrugging off the government shutdown, and is more focused on earnings optimism and the prospect of additional Federal Reserve rate cuts,” said Robert Edwards, chief investment officer at Edwards Asset Management.  “We would consider any notable market dip from the shutdown as an ‘Investor Prime Day’ shopping opportunity,” he also said. “Even with the government shutdown and worries about the labor market, we believe the S&P 500 is on track to cross 7,000 by year-end.”  Despite the data blackout, several Federal Reserve officials are slated to speak this week, including Fed Governor Stephen Miran on Wednesday and Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday.

Its impact was felt in investor circles Friday, as it delayed the release of the data, leaving Wall Street and the Federal Reserve in the dark. In its absence, Wall Street has turned to a bevy of private data that has confirmed the labor market's sharp slowdown this week.  But even amid the unanswered questions on the health of the US economy, stocks keep rising to new records, largely on the back of continued AI fervor. OpenAI's valuation climbed to $500 billion, making the company the most valuable startup in the world.  On Friday, new AI deals boosted optimism. Hitachi LTD (6501.T) teamed up with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) on energy projects, while Fujitsu (6501.T) expanded work with Nvidia (NVDA). Other sectors also continued standout performances — most notably pharma stocks, which by one measure were headed toward their best week in over a decade.  Meanwhile, there was no immediate end in sight to the shutdown. Democrats continue to push for the continuation of healthcare subsidies as a condition of funding the government, while Republicans refuse to negotiate on the issue until the government is back up and running. At the same time, President Trump has continued to ramp up his threats to fire federal workers and defund projects in Democratic-leaning states.

The broad market index closed little changed, ticking up just 0.01% at 6,715.79, while the Nasdaq Composite  declined 0.28% to settle at 22,780.51. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, trading higher by 238.56 points, or 0.51%, to finish at 46,758.28. The Russell 2000  also popped 0.72% to close at 2,476.18. All four benchmarks had hit all-time highs earlier in the session.  Stocks were knocked down a bit in afternoon trading by declines in key technology names like Palantir Technologies  , Tesla and Nvidia. Palantir led the S&P 500′s pullback, falling 7.5%, while Tesla and Nvidia dropped more than 1% and almost 1%, respectively. The CBOE Volatility Index  spiked, signaling some investors were scrambling to buy some protection against a future S&P 500 decline in the form of put contracts.  Still, the three leading indexes saw a positive weekly finish. The broad market S&P 500 rose around 1.1% on the week, along with the 30-stock Dow, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq increased 1.3%. The small-cap Russell has jumped nearly 2% in the period.  Investors have been overlooking anxieties surrounding the government shutdown, which entered its third day Friday. While the stoppage has exacerbated underlying concerns this year about macroeconomic and policy headwinds, inflation risks and a slowing labor market, investors expect it to be short-lived, thereby limiting potential hits to the U.S. economy. Those on Wall Street also believe that the shutdown won’t stop the momentum in the artificial intelligence trade. Shutdowns have not been market-moving events in the past.  The shutdown has led to an economic data blackout, and the Labor Department’s pause on virtually all activity has blocked the Friday release of the September nonfarm payrolls report. Although that removes a factor that could lend pressure to stocks, it lessens the amount of economic data the Federal Reserve can take into account for its interest rate decision at its October meeting. Markets largely expect the central bank will lower its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point then, per the CME FedWatch tool.  Adding to ongoing concerns regarding the jobs market, President Donald Trump has threatened massive layoffs and said Thursday that the Democrats have given him an “unprecedented opportunity” to cut federal agencies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also told CNBC Thursday that the current lapse in federal funding could lead to “a hit to the GDP, a hit to growth and a hit to working America.” The Congressional Budget Office estimates 750,000 federal workers will be furloughed each day.  Their remarks come a day after private payrolls posted their biggest decline since March 2023 in September, according to ADP. Wednesday’s report serves as yet another sign that the labor market is weakening, and some believe that the state of the labor market combined with the shutdown bolster the case for the Fed to cut.  “We view September’s mixed, private-sourced substitutes for the Labor Department’s delayed jobs report as soft enough to justify another interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve at the October 29 FOMC meeting,” said Jennifer Timmerman, senior investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “Prospects for further rate cutting by the Fed, reinforced by the yellow flag for the economy raised by the latest jobs data, has cemented a rally in stocks and left the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note low enough, at 4.11%, to lift the S&P 500 to a fresh all-time high.”"

But six failed votes later — and with poll results showing the GOP is taking slightly more of the blame while plans for ""permanent"" cuts from President Trump have yet to materialize — it's Republican resolve that is increasingly in question.  High-profile GOP defectors are now openly pushing their leaders to reverse course and come to the negotiating table over the thorny issue of reviving expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies.  And Trump has said multiple times this week he is open to healthcare talks — albeit with a shifting message on timing — saying Thursday at a cabinet meeting, ""We are the ones that are saving healthcare.""

Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports:  The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.3% this week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, from 6.34% a week earlier. Average 15-year mortgage rates were 5.53%, from 5.55%.  For the past month, mortgage rates have settled in a narrow range around 6.3%. There’s been little to spur big movements. The latest jobs report, which in recent months has sparked big moves in mortgage rates, was originally scheduled for release last Friday, but has been delayed due to the government shutdown. Markets have instead been relying on alternative data sources, like ADP’s payrolls report for private employers.  That data, released Oct. 1, showed that the US shed 32,000 jobs in September. The dismal numbers briefly sent the 10-year Treasury yield, which mortgage rates closely track, lower, but it’s since rebounded.  Read more here.

The agreement by Israel and Hamas to President Trump's proposal marks the first substantive step in months toward negotiations to potentially end the war.  As conflict in the Middle East had spilled outside of Israel and Palestine's borders, oil prices initially spiked upward — especially as Israel and Iran briefly exchanged airstrikes in early June — on worries of a substantive decrease of Iranian oil supply to the global market. But the spike was short-lived, and both Brent crude and WTI crude are down roughly 12% on the year.  Rystad Energy, a global energy consultancy and research firm, said substantive price movement will hinge on the long-term success or failure of a peace deal and, separately, developments in the war in Ukraine."

Here's what you need to know today.  1. Stock Futures Rise as Government Shutdown Continues  Stock futures are higher in premarket trading as investors monitor for new developments in the U.S. government shutdown. S&P 500 futures were higher by 0.3% recently, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 0.2%, after both of the major indexes climbed to record highs Friday. Nasdaq futures were up 0.7%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence the borrowing costs on a range of consumer loans, edged up to 4.16%.  2. Bitcoin, Gold Hit New Highs  Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is trading at just above $124,000 after it hit a new high over the weekend amid uncertainty surrounding a U.S. government shutdown and waning value of the U.S. dollar. The cryptocurrency rose above $125,000 early Sunday morning, surpassing the previous high of $124,480 set in August. Bitcoin is up more than 50% from its April lows of around $80,000. Investors seeking safety also pushed gold prices to new highs, with futures trading of the yellow metal at more than $3,950 an ounce.  3. Oil Futures Move Higher as OPEC Announces Modest Production Increase  Oil futures advanced in premarket trading after oil producing countries announced a production boost that was smaller than some investors expected. Oil futures traded at around $62 a barrel, up about 2% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) announced a production increase of 137,000 barrels a day in November. That’s the same level of increase announced for October, where some analysts had expected an even larger increase in November.1  4. AMD Stock Surges on Chip Deal with OpenAI  Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are higher by 25% in premarket trading after the chipmaker announced a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to build 6 gigawatts of computing power using AMD chips, with the first gigawatt of deployment planned for the second half of 2026. The announcement didn’t include details on costs. Shares of rival chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) are 2% lower in early trading.2  5. Tesla Stock Gains After Teasing Tuesday Event  Tesla (TSLA) is teasing an Oct. 7 event that some analysts believe could bring an announcement related to a lower-cost vehicle in the U.S., with one social media post by the company showing a vehicle’s headlights.345 Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made a lower-cost version of its electric vehicle a goal of the company and was reportedly planning a cheaper version of its Model Y SUV for the Chinese market next year. The event comes after Tesla’s third-quarter deliveries came in better than expected. Tesla shares are higher by more than 2% in premarket trading.  Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Learn about our editorial policies  Published October 10, 2025  08:42 AM EDT  Traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are on track to post gains for the week.  Michael Nagle / Bloomberg / Getty Images  Stock futures are pointing to a slightly higher open after major indexes lost ground yesterday; the Bureau of Labor Statistics will bring back employees in order to produce a key inflation report; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus after the AI darling hit a new all-time high; Applied Digital (APLD) stock is soaring on a strong earnings report and announcement of new data center deals; and shares of Levi Strauss (LEVI) are down even as the jeans maker reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its outlook. Here's what you need to know today.  1. Stock Futures Inch Higher, Gold Back Above $4,000  Stock futures are higher this morning as the market looks to rebound from Thursday's downturn. Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were each up 0.2% recently. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq come into today's session up 0.2% for the week, while the Dow has lost 0.8% over the period. Investors will be keeping a close eye on consumer sentiment data that's slated for release this morning. Gold futures were up about 1%, trading at around $4,010 an ounce, after slipping below the $4,000 threshold on Thursday following several days of record highs. Bitcoin was trading at $121,500, up slightly from its overnight lows. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences interest rates on consumer loans, declined to 4.10% from 4.15% yesterday afternoon.  2. Government to Bring Back Furloughed Workers for Inflation Report  Despite a federal government shutdown that is now in its tenth day, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will reportedly bring back some furloughed employees in order to produce the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report for September. The Wall Street Journal reported that employees who produce the inflation data are being brought back because the data is used to calculate Social Security payments.1 The CPI report was originally scheduled for release next Wednesday, though it's unclear when the data will now be released. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been told to stay home as legislators continue to negotiate over the expiring healthcare subsidies that are at the root of the shutdown.  3. Nvidia Shares Gaining After Hitting New High  Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are poised to add to their record highs following a week of encouraging developments for the AI chipmaker. Bloomberg reported that the U.S. approved the sale of several billion dollars worth of Nvidia AI chip sales to the United Arab Emirates. The deal comes amid progress in negotiations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia on a chip deal that would include Nvidia, according to a Wall Street Journal report. CEO Jensen Huang earlier this week said that AI has “substantially” boosted demand for computing power, comments that gave the stock a boost. Nvidia shares were up 0.7% in recent premarket trading, after tacking on nearly 2% yesterday. The stock has gained 43% since the start of the year, boosting its market capitalization to around $4.7 trillion, making it the world's most-valuable company by a wide margin.  4. Applied Digital Soars on Earnings Beat, New Deal with CoreWeave  Shares of Applied Digital (APLD) surged in premarket trading after the AI data center builder posted better-than-expected earnings and reported on new deals. The Nvidia-backed firm reported an 84% jump in quarterly revenue to $64.2 million, above the $54.5 million projected by analysts tracked by Visible Alpha.2 Applied Digital reported an adjusted loss of 3 cents a share, in line with Wall Street analysts' expectations. The firm also said it finalized a new lease agreement with AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave (CRWV), bringing the total revenue for its North Dakota facility to $11 billion. Applied Digital shares, which had gained 280% so far this year as of yesterday's close, were up nearly 30% before the bell Friday.  5. Levi’s Shares Decline Despite Strong Earnings, Improved Outlook  Shares of Levi Strauss (LEVI) slumped in premarket trading after the jeans maker reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its full-year outlook despite facing continued tariff pressures. Levi’s reported a 7% increase in third-quarter revenue to $1.54 billion, slightly above analysts' consensus view of $1.5 billion.3 The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 34 cents, above the 31 cents Wall Street had expected. Levi’s also said its now expects 2025 revenue to rise 6% and adjusted EPS to be between $1.27 and $1.32 per share, both above prior estimates. Levi’s raised its estimates despite projecting tariffs of 30% on Chinese imports and 20% on goods from other countries. The stock was down 7.5% recently."

While the temporary government shutdown is certainly having an adverse effect on certain parts of the economy that rely (either totally or in part) on government workers, it's not slowing the pace of artificial intelligence (AI) development. Companies building data center infrastructure, for instance, are still spending aggressively because no one wants to risk falling behind (although certain government permitting and interactions could slow things temporarily).  Let's look at three stocks riding the AI boom to buy now that are unlikely to be stalled by the current heated political wrangling going on in Washington, D.C.  Artist rendering of an AI chip.  Image source: Getty Images.  Nvidia  Nvidia (  NVDA  +1.68%) has quietly been evolving from a provider of graphics processing units (GPUs) that power AI workloads into a company that is starting to shape how data centers get built and where AI is headed. The company's CUDA software platform, upon which most foundational AI code has been built, has given the company a wide moat, but it is starting to go beyond that.  Nvidia Stock Quote  NASDAQ: NVDA  Nvidia  Today's Change  (1.68%) $3.14  Current Price  $190.00  NVDA  Key Data Points  Market Cap  $4621B  Day's Range  $180.58 - $191.01  52wk Range  $86.62 - $212.19  Volume  5.8M  Avg Vol  184M  Gross Margin  69.85%  Dividend Yield  0.00%  The company is now dictating the shape of entire data center buildouts, packaging its chips with proprietary networking, cooling, and software stacks, and in some cases deciding which customers get the earliest shipments of its top-end hardware. Nvidia's recent investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI is part of that strategy, as it locks in a huge customer for its highest-end chips while the two companies will work together to shape how the next generation of large language models is trained. This follows an earlier investment in Intel in which the company will use its central processing units (CPUs) and start to jointly develop chips.  And while ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) for AI workloads are on the rise, it has been reported that even powerhouses Amazon and Alphabet give Nvidia notice before announcing any updates to their custom chips. That is power right there, and why Nvidia is a stock to buy.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  Quite simply, there is no AI without Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (  TSM  +0.90%). TSMC currently manufactures nearly all of the world's most advanced chips, not just for Nvidia but also for other competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom.

Join The Motley Fool today and revealed what we believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now.  Continue ›  *Stock Advisor returns as of November 16, 2025.  TSMC's competitive edge is well known, as it has been the only foundry that can consistently produce high yields at smaller node sizes, which is needed to scale the manufacturing of advanced chips like GPUs. What is often overlooked is how that has shifted the balance of power to the company.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Stock Quote  NYSE: TSM  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  Today's Change  (0.90%) $2.55  Current Price  $284.75  TSM  Key Data Points  Market Cap  $1477B  Day's Range  $273.25 - $286.83  52wk Range  $134.25 - $311.37  Volume  666K  Avg Vol  13M  Gross Margin  58.06%  Dividend Yield  0.01%  While customers may want to diversify suppliers, they also cannot risk moving their most advanced designs elsewhere because no other foundry can match TSMC's consistency at scale. The company has been using that leverage to raise prices as it invests heavily in fabs outside Taiwan. It's also made TSMC much more of a partner to chipmakers than simply a contract manufacturer. Chip designers now must work with TSMC on their product roadmaps and secure future production well in advance.  Like Nvidia, TSMC has a lot of power in the AI infrastructure industry that cannot be ignored.  ASML  Perhaps the company most vital to the AI infrastructure buildout is often the one most overlooked. ASML (  ASML  1.44%) has an effective monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, the equipment that is required to print the smallest transistors on advanced chips. Without it, neither Nvidia nor TSMC would be in the position they are in today, because its technology is needed to make advanced chips.

The story with ASML is straightforward but powerful. As long as demand for AI chips drives foundries to expand capacity and shrink node sizes (how many transistors that can fit on a chip), ASML will keep selling a lot of EUV machines.  Its move to take a stake in Mistral AI shows it is not standing still on innovation, but the real investment case is its unrivaled grip on the one technology that keeps shrinking node sizes. That makes it a powerful growth stock that is insulated from consumer trends and government shutdowns.  Should you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

The 10-year yield dipped to 4.13%.  The S&P and Nasdaq actually hit their highest intraday levels on record earlier in the morning, but riskier assets and those tied to the AI trade turned south as consumer staples, utilities, financials, and health care stocks gained steam.  AI stocks specifically suffered in the wake of a report from The Information, which cited internal documents at Oracle about the firm’s margins in its cloud business. The report suggested monetizing the AI buildout is still in its early stages.  Oracle rebounded a bit after Fox Business anchor Liz Claman reported, citing sources familiar to the situation, that the report on Oracle “does not reflect the actual financials of that business.”  Whatever the reason, AI stocks have been on a tear in recent weeks amid a flurry of headlines regarding investments and partnerships related to chip makers and generative AI powerhouses. Most recently, OpenAI announced a partnership with AMD that sent the chipmaker surging.  The government shutdown hit its seventh day, but that hasn’t stopped the major indexes from hitting multiple record highs."

Michael Nagle / Bloomberg via Getty Images  Major stock indexes closed lower after the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq hit fresh records Thursday, while safe-haven gold fell back below $4,000, as the U.S. government shutdown continued.  The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq ended a respective 0.5%, 0.3%, and 0.1% lower. Yesterday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 posted record closing highs, while the Dow ended down by just one point.  Gold futures, which have soared 50% this year and crossed the $4,000 threshold for the first time this week amid a flight to safety, pulled back 2% to $3,990.  The 10-year Treasury yield—which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans—ticked higher to 4.14%. Bitcoin fell 2% to about $121,000. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, advanced 0.5% to 99.44. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures was down 1.7% to $61.50 per barrel.  Thursday was the ninth day of the U.S. government shutdown, and there are no obvious signs the funding stalemate will end soon, with President Donald Trump saying during a Cabinet meeting today that the White House plans to eliminate programs popular with Democrats.  In corporate news, shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) surged 4.3% after the carrier reported record third-quarter revenue and issued a rosy outlook for Q4, while PepsiCo (PEP) stock rose 4.2% to lead after the soda and snacks giant's Q3 results topped estimates and it replaced its CFO as Elliott Investment Management presses for change.  Elsewhere, Nvidia (NVDA) shares advanced 1.8% to hit an all-time high on a report the White House and Saudi Arabia are nearing a deal to allow U.S. chipmakers to export semiconductors to the Gulf nation.  Also, Akero Therapeutics (AKRO) shares popped 16% after Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced it was buying the firm working on a liver disease treatment for up to $5.2 billion; Ferrari (RACE) shares sank 15% after the Italian luxury carmaker issued a soft outlook; and Tesla (TSLA) stock slipped 0.7% after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into the electric vehicle maker's Full Self-Driving software.  In addition, Costco Wholesale (COST) stock rose 3.1% after it reported strong monthly sales figures, while Boeing (BA) was the worst-performing stock in the Dow, with shares down 4.1% after Turkish Airlines' chair said the carrier might switch a recent order for 150 737 MAX planes to Airbus if engine talks fail."
